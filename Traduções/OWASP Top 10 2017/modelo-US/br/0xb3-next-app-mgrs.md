# +A: What's next for Application Managers

## Manage the full Application Lifecycle

Applications are some of the most complex systems humans regularly create and maintain. IT management for an application should be performed by IT specialists who are responsible for the overall IT lifecycle of an application. 

We suggest establishing application owners and application managers for every application to provide accountability, responsibility, consulted and informed (RACI). The application manager is the technical counterpart of the application owner from business perspective and manages the full application lifecycle, including the security of an application, associate data assets, and documentation. This can help with understanding who can sign off risks, who is responsible for including security.

## Requirements and Resource Management

* Collect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the business, including receiving the protection requirements in regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data assets
* Compile the technical requirements including functional and non functional security requirements
* Plan and negotiate the budget that covers all aspects of design, build, testing and operation, including security activities

## Request for Proposals (RFP) and Contracting

* Negotiate with internal or external developers the requirements, including guidelines and security requirements with respect to your security program, e.g. SDLC, best practices
* Rate the fulfillment of all technical requirements including a rough planning and design
* Negotiate all technical requirements including design, security and service level agreements (SLA)
* Consider adopting templates and checklists, such as [OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Software_Contract_Annex) **NB**: The Annex is a sample specific to US contract law, and is likely to need legal review in your jurisdiction. Please consult qualified legal advice before using the Annex.

## Planning and Design

* Negotiate planning and design with the developers and internal shareholders, e.g. security specialists
* Define a security architecture, controls, and countermeasures according the protection needs and the planned environmental security level. This should be supported by security specialists.
* Get the application owner to assume remaining risks or to provide additional resources.
* Each sprint, ensure security stories are created for functional requirements, and constraints added for non-functional requirements

## Development

* Please review the +D "What's next for developers" for guidance.

## Deployment, Testing and Rollout

* It's critical that security tasks automated the secure setup of the application, interfaces and of all further components needed, including required authorizations
* Test the technical functions and integration to the IT architecture, and coordinate business tests. Consider to test use and abuse cases from technical and business perspectives.
* Manage security tests according to internal processes, the protection needs and the level of security where the application is going to be deployed
* Put the application in operation and migrate from previously used applications
* Finalize all documentation, including the CMDB and security architecture

## Operating and Changes

* Operating including the security management for the application (e.g. patch management)
* Regularly report all users and authorizations to the application owner and get them acknowledged
* Raise the security awareness of users and manage conflicts about usability vs security
* Plan and manage changes, e.g. migrate to new versions of the application or other components like OS, middleware and libraries
* Update all documentation, including in CMDB and the security architecture, controls, and countermeasures, including any runbooks or project documentation

## Retiring Systems

* Implement business requirements for data retention (deletion) policies and securely archiving data
* Securely close down the application, including deleting unused accounts and roles and permissions
* Set your application’s state to retired in the CMDB
